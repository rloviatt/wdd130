                Hi, my name is Russell Oviatt. I am from Afton, Wyoming which is part of a greater area called Star Valley which may be more recognizable.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am a CIT Major and don't really have a specific career in mind, I'll cross that bridge once I get to it.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am not married but do have a girlfriend who also attends BYUI and is a psychology major, we've been dating for almost 3 years. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I have three siblings, two sisters and a brother. My two older siblings, one of the sisters and the brother, have both graduated college while my younger sister is still in high school.
            </p>
            <p>
                Outside of class I like to play video games, my favorite is probably either Bloodborne or Elden Ring. I recently finished Lies of P, which I thought was really good. 
            </p> 
            <p>
                I used to read a lot too, but haven't been able to find as much time for that hobby recently, there's only so many hours in a given day. Back when I did read more extensively it was mainly fantasy and some science fiction. My favorite author is Robin Hobb specifically her books about FitzChivalry, I also like Brandon Sanderson (I'm one among many on that front) and Orson Scott Card although I've only read his books set in the Enderverse.
